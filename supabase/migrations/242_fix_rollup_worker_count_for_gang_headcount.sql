-- Live proof: after 241's fix, the underlying data was correct
-- (gang_size=5, all 5 names in gang_member_staff_ids/gang_member_names)
-- but the printed Payment Request still read "1 worker". Root cause:
-- v_worker_count was COUNT(*) FROM _rollup_workers. A gang-total entry
-- always collapses to ONE row (GROUP BY ts.staff_id, and every gang-total
-- day is saved against the same anchor staff_id) no matter how many
-- people were in the gang -- so the row count is always 1 for a
-- gang-leader requisition, while the real headcount sits unused in
-- that row's gang_size column.
--
-- Fix: count headcount as the sum of each row's gang_size (falling back
-- to 1 per row when it's an ungrouped individual entry), not the row
-- count itself. For individual-model rollups (gang_size always NULL)
-- this is identical to the old COUNT(*) behavior.
